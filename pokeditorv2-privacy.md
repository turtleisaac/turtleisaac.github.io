# Privacy Policy

PokEditor v2, developed by turtleisaac ("we," "us," "our"), takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we believe Google collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our online mode, which is an optional feature that utilizes the Google Sheets API ("the tool").

## Information Collection

PokEditor v2 does not collect any user data. However, when you use the tool's optional online mode, Google may collect certain information about you, including:

- Information you provide to us: Google may collect information that you provide to us when you authorize the tool to access your Google Sheets account. This may include your name, email address, and other information necessary to grant permissions to the tool.

- Information about your use of the tool: Google may collect information about your use of the tool, including which spreadsheets you access and how you interact with them.

- Information from third-party sources: Google may receive information about you from third-party sources, such as other websites or services that you use in conjunction with the tool.

## Use of Information

Google may use the information they collect for the following purposes:

- To provide the tool's functionality and improve it over time.

- To communicate with you about the tool and updates to our Privacy Policy.

- To comply with legal obligations.

## Sharing of Information

Google may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:

- With your consent: Google may share your information with third parties with your consent.

- For legal reasons: Google may share your information with third parties if they believe it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or protect their legal rights.

## Affiliation with Google

The tool has no affiliation with Google, and solely utilizes their API for online mode. Google is a separate entity from the tool, and their information collection practices are governed by their own privacy policy.

## Data Security

Google takes reasonable measures to protect the information they collect from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, no security measures are foolproof, so they cannot guarantee the security of your information.

## Your Choices

You can control the data that is collected by the tool by managing your Google Account settings.

## Contact Google

If you have any questions about how Google collects, uses, or shares information about you, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy or contact them directly.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use the tool to stay informed about Google's information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
